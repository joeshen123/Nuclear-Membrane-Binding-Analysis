# Nuclear-Membrane-Binding-Analysis

This repository contains the image-analysis pipeline and code used to quantify nuclear-membrane invaginations/folds, nuclear volume, and protein nuclear‚Äëmembrane **adsorption** for the manuscript:

> **‚ÄúEndoplasmic reticulum disruption stimulates nuclear membrane mechanotransduction.‚Äù**

The pipeline processes 3D fluorescence microscopy datasets, extracts morphology and intensity metrics, and exports publication‚Äëready measurements and visualizations.

## üìå Overview

Key capabilities

- Robust 3D nuclear segmentation from z‚Äëstacks/time‚Äëlapse movies
- Morphometrics: volume and nuclear‚Äëmembrane folds/invaginations
- Protein rim‚Üîcenter binding quantification
- Protein rim‚ÜîLMNB1 (median across nuclear mid‚Äësection) binding quantification

## Data flow

1. `Image_Import.py` converts raw **.nd2** movies into a single **.hdf5** (HDF5) file that stores the image stack as a NumPy array.
2. `Nucleus_3D_Analysis_Program.py` loads that `.hdf5`, performs segmentation/quantification (via `Nucleus_Analysis_Module.py`), and writes:
   - Segmentation results (**.hdf5**)
   - Measurements (**.csv**)
3. `segmentation_result_visualization.py` (optional) generates segmentation‚Äëmask and raw images overlay in Napari Viewer for the users to assess segmentation accuracy.

## ‚ú® Organization

This repository contains **three analysis programs** with the same layout:

- **Invagination/Fold analysis + Volume Analysis**
- **Rim vs nucleoplasm binding ratio + Volume Analysis**
- **Rim vs LMNB1 (median at mid‚Äësection) binding ratio + Volume Analysis**

> Each program directory includes the files below.

| File                                   | Purpose                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `environment.yaml`                     | Dependency specification (Conda/Mamba).                                             |
| `Image_Import.py`                      | Import raw `.nd2` movies ‚Üí export a consolidated `.hdf5` (NumPy array inside HDF5). |
| `Nucleus_3D_Analysis_Program.py`       | Load the `.hdf5`, run segmentation & metrics via the module, save results.          |
| `Nucleus_Analysis_Module.py`           | Reusable functions for I/O, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction.        |
| `segmentation_result_visualization.py` | Present segmentation alongside intermediate results and raw data in the Napari viewer, enabling users to compare and assess segmentation accuracy.                                 |
|`aicssegmentation`                      | Contains accessory functions used by the program|

## ‚öô Installation

We recommend **micromamba** for environment management. (Conda works as well.)

```bash
# Micromamba
micromamba create -n nucleus_analysis --file environment.yaml
micromamba activate nucleus_analysis
```

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
conda activate nucleus_analysis
```

## üöÄ Quick Start (GUI file selection)

1. **Open the folder** in **Visual Studio Code** or **PyCharm**.

2. **Run** **Image_Import.py**\
   ‚Ä¢ You will be prompted to select the folder that contains all raw **.nd2** movie(s).\
   ‚Ä¢ For each ND2 file, the script writes a single **.hdf5** file that contains the image stack as a NumPy array.\
3. **Run** **Nucleus_3D_Analysis_Program.py**\
   ‚Ä¢ Select one `.hdf5` file from step 2.\
   ‚Ä¢ The program produces:\
   ‚Äì **Segmentation results** (.hdf5)\
   ‚Äì **Measurement results** (.csv)
   
4. *(Optional)* **Run** **segmentation_result_visualization.py** to inspect overlays and accuracy of segmentation mask.

## üì§ Outputs

- **HDF5 (segmentation)**: labeled/processed image data for downstream checks
- **CSV (metrics)**: per‚Äëobject and/or per‚Äëframe measurements (e.g., volume and protein adsorption ratio )


---

## üß™ Reproducibility

- The **.hdf5** exported by `Image_Import.py` is the canonical intermediate used by the analysis program.
- Keep acquisition metadata (voxel size, z‚Äëstep, channels) with each dataset.
- Pin exact versions in `environment.yaml`; consider exporting with `--from-history` to keep it minimal.

---

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

- **Cannot find selected files**: ensure you launched scripts from the correct program directory.
- **ND2 import errors**: confirm ND2 reader dependencies from `environment.yaml` are installed.
- **Large datasets**: reduce ROI or downsample for a quick test; process in chunks if supported.
